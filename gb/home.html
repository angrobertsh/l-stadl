					<p>Lederhosen Stadl is Berlin's first and only shop for Bavarian Lederhosen and traditional Bavarian accessories. We are located in the heart of Berlin's Shoeneberg district, just a 5 minute walk away from the famous KaDeWe, between Wittenbergplatz and Nollendorfplatz. Since 2009, we have been a popular meeting point for international lovers of high quality handmade Bavarian Lederhosen, Bavarian hats, suspenders, shoes, and more. Visit our store to create a head-to-toe authentic, traditional Bavarian look.</p>
					<p>In addition to Bavarian Lederhosen, our shop offers a wide range of black leather goods, such as second hand motorcycle gear, and fetish clothing. Come see our collection of heavy police and military boots ("Knobelbecher"), and police and motorcycle jackets. We also carry industrial rubber, latex, and craftsmen's clothes in our constantly updating offerings. The transition from traditional clothing to fetish is often fluent--our range spans antique to unworn, and traditional to fetish.</p>
					<p>I would like to invite you to the heart of Berlins gay community to visit us. Welcome.</p>
